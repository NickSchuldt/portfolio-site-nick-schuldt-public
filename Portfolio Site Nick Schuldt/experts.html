          <h2 id="Overview">Overview- Experts a UX Case Study</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Challenge: Every day people encounter problems in their daily life. Most of the time they are able to solve it themselves. However; some tasks can be just a little out of their wheel house. This is where Experts can help users by
            connecting them with a consultant to help walk them through their problem.</li>
            <li>Solution: Experts is a smartphone app that provides users the ability to video call consultants that have expert knowledge in order to help our users solve problems that may be to difficult to solve on their own.</li>
            <li>My Role: This project was created as part of my UX/UI designer certification. My role in this project involved: User Research, creating user personas/journeys, user flows, wireframing, prototyping and user testing.</li>
            <li>Tools: Adobe XD, Balsamiq, Optimal Sort, Usability Hub</li>
            <li>Duration: July 2020-March 2021</li>

        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
          Our users need an app that allows them to connect to experts for virtually any questions they may have.  We need to make sure this is done in a timely manner with a great deal of accuracy while also making the user feel like they are
          getting the most out of there money.  Along with this we need to make sure they can find an expert in the field they want with ease.
          We will know this to be true when a user can find the expert they need in minutes along with getting a accurate response/reply within a couple hours of posting there question and ultimately coming back for futures questions that may require
          an expert.

              <li>3 users were interviewed during this process.</li>
              <li>The biggest questions looking to be answered were what features would they like to get out of this app and what price they would be willing to pay for.</li>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>User journey maps were created in order to help us better understand goals and expectations my users may experience. Along with this it helped define tasks the app would need to perform for different users.</li>
          <li>By creating these user journeys it helped me realize certain features I didn't previously think of. 1 such feature would be a message all for someone who is in a rush and wanted immediate help. Another issue that was raised was making
            sure people knew who were online and offline.</li>
          <li>All of the user journey's for my personas were created from the data received from the survey and user interviews.</li>
